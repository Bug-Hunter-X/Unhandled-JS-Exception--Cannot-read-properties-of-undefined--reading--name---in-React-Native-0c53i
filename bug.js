This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is a common issue in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations. For example, if you are fetching data from an API, the state variable might not be updated immediately, leading to the error.  Here's a code example illustrating the problem:

```javascript
// bug.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(json => setData(json));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text>  {/* Error: Can't read properties of undefined (reading 'name') */}
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
